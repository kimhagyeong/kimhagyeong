### Hi there 👋

Hello. I'm Kim Ha-gyeong, a third-year developer with a dream of becoming a good colleagues without stopping at being exceptional developers.     
I graduated from university with a degree in computer science engineering, and I had started a platform business for a year for front-end when I was a senior in college. Not the end, I worked on back-end projects and jobs about DevOps at ebaykroea data platform team for two years.

<br/><br/>
I'm interested in the DevOps area. If my knowledge of the web develops well combined with it, I’m suppose to provide many data science experiences for users.    
<br/><br/>

As a result of working at a data platform team for two years, I noticed that the justification for the “data platform” is quite different according to companies. Some companies just treat “data pipeline”. On the other hand, the other companies provide data operations and data science. At this point, my opinion is that, we would better give the integration UI service for easy to control datas, if not data science. That’s the reason why I have been working for toy projects continuously to not to forget the sense of web development, while I have been working at the data platform team simultaneously.
