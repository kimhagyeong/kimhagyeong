### Hi there 👋

Hello. I'm Kim Ha-gyeong, a third-year developer with a dream of becoming a good colleagues without stopping at being exceptional developers.     
I graduated from university with a degree in computer science engineering, and I had started a platform business for a year for front-end when I was a senior in college. Not the end, I worked on back-end projects and jobs about DevOps at ebaykroea data platform team for two years.

I'm interested in the DataEngineering area. If my knowledge of the web develops well combined with it, I’m suppose to provide many data science experiences for users.
